## Readme
`file_match_file.py` allows you to sort a set of files according to a given .torrent file.
The sorting will be done in a way that you can resume seeding the files in a torrent client.

Unfortunately, due to the structure of .torrent files, small files are not processed by this program and will need to be re-downloaded. Additionally, if some files are missing, the torrent client may consider that there is no beginning or end of an existing file.
